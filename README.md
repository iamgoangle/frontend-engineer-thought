## CSS at the top inside `</head>`, JS at the bottom before `</body>`

We think about prevention browser rendering blocking resources. 
To prevent displaying a page with delayed (white page) we should be placed `<script>` at a bottom, 
since rendering engine can be displayed until resources has loaded. 

That's means we allows rendering engine displays `<body>` as fast as it can, before execution JS.
